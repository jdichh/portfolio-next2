# Personal Portfolio v2
I've remade my portfolio in Next.js 13 to learn the basics of it. I'd say I've learned quite a lot by "remastering" it.

[This](https://jdichh.netlify.app/) was the previous version made only with HTML, SCSS and JS.

## Achievement over v1
<strong>Update (Oct. 12, 2023): </strong> I've revised some aspects of my original Next.js portfolio (v1) such as improved theme switching, file-directory structure, etc.

I managed to reduce the Load time of the landing page from around 5.5 - 6 seconds to at most 800ms, & the blog pages from around 10-12 seconds to at most 1.4 seconds; resulting in around <strong>88% reduction in loadtimes</strong>. I tested it with Chrome's DevTools by emptying the cache and hard reloading.

Great success!
