# Personal Portfolio v2
I've remade my portfolio in Next.js 13 to learn the basics of it. I'd say I've learned quite a lot by "remastering" it.

<strong>Update (Oct. 12, 2023): </strong> I've revised some aspects of my original Next.js portfolio (v1) such as improved theme switching, file-directory structure, etc.
