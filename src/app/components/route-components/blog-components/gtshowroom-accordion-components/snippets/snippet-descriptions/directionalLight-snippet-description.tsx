        I created an instance of <code>THREE.Scene</code>, which initializes the

        A new instance of <code>THREE.DirectionalLight</code> is created, and

        And I configured the <code>directionalLight</code>'s shadow camera. They
        basically determine how shadows are calculated and displayed. For
        example, near and far define the range within which shadows are
        rendered, and mapSize sets the resolution of the shadow map.
