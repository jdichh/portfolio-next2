        The <code>Promise.all([...])</code> block is used to load multiple
        textures asynchronously. It waits for all the textures to be loaded
        before proceeding.

        I created a geometry for the floor (essentially defining its shape)
        using <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code>, and it will have the width and

        I defined a material for the floor using{" "}
        <code>THREE.MeshLambertMaterial</code>. This material combines several
        textures: <code>map</code> is the main color texture (floorTexture)
        applied to the floor. <code>displacementMap</code> (dispMap) gives the
        floor a bumpy appearance. <code>normalMap</code> (normalGL) adds details
        to the surface to simulate lighting effects. and <code>aoMap</code>{" "}
        (amb_occ) represents ambient occlusion, which affects how light
        interacts with the surface.

        I created a 3D mesh object (the floor) by combining the geometry and
        material.

      <li className="mb-3">
        I applied some more additional settings to the floor, such as allowing
        it to receive shadows and adjusting its position and rotation. Because
        the default setting is that the plane is upright, so I used some "quick
        maths" to make it lie down (Refer to <code>floor.rotation.x</code>).
