            <p className="article-text">
              During the earlier days of my journey in learning frontend
              development, which started around June 2023, I came across a video
              in my recommended section in YouTube. It was about making a
              portfolio in 3D, with something called{" "}

            </p>

            <p className="article-text">
              So imagine what my reaction was at the video YouTube recommended
              to me. Think about it, if you were new to frontend web
              development, and you saw that? What would your reaction be? Oh
              man. Well, I was shocked, but in a positive manner. Because I
              thought, at the time, that frontend was just about React, Vue,
              Angular, and all that jazz. So I took it upon myself to get to
              know and learn how Three.js worked.

              I looked at the documentations that Three.js provided. I was so

              was a great read by the way, as it helped me understand more of

              It's a trick used by many games, to give you the illusion that
              there's a huge map during a corridor-style level (like Temple Run,
              remember that?)â€”when in actuality, a part of the map's terrain is
              just regenerated after the camera has passed it. It's like walking
              or running on a treadmill, in simpler terms.

              I followed Maxime's instructions and guidelines, but not blindly.
              I took the time to understand what some things meant, because

              for code, and not understand it? Yeah, I'm talking to you, Jason

              Anyway, I didn't want to end the project with a 1:1 copy of his
              work; I wanted to add more things, like a sun, a skybox,
              background music, some postprocessing effects like bloom and a CRT
              filter, and maybe some other tweaks if I found the need to act
              upon them. So I made sure to accomplish these tasks that I set for
              myself.

              quite apocalyptic, and wasn't the "vibe" I was going for. So I

              A displacement map basically tells a computer how to make a flat
