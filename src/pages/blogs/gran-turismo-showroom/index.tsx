              Would you believe me, a 22 year-old guy, doesn't have a driver's
              license yet or hasn't driven a car out on public roads? Well maybe
              you will, but, anyway, I hadn't really experienced driving yet,
              especially the type of driving that can potentially put you in a
              police chase. So, naturally, playing driving/racing games was my
              escape.

              after ripping through the transmission to change gears; hearing
              the tires squeal for mercy, telling you—shouting at you that
              they're at the tipping point between traction and slippage. For
              the sole reason of beating the other guys to the finish line.

              My love for cars, especially the Dodge Viper and all of its
              iterations, and just about anything automotive, began with a game
              on the PlayStation 1 called Test Drive 6. Hearing a cover of Gary
              Numan's song "Cars" play in the intro (the original is better),
              crashing out police cars and other competitors alike, reminds me
              of good times back from when I was just a young, fat(ter) kid.

              Test Drive 6 was great (to me). But the Gran Turismo series, as a
              whole, has always been closer to my heart. Not just because of the
              cars, and the quality of the racetracks themselves; the
              presentation, coupled with the glorious soundtrack, has always
              been top-tier ever since its first release. This was also where I
              discovered my love for jazz and funk.

              on, showing me the glorious boot-up screen, and then off to the

              After finishing the synthwave project, I started to think what

              configurator in 3D? Nope, I don't even know where to start with
              that yet. How about a product page, featuring the product in 3D?
              Perhaps.

              And it suddenly dawned on me, my first output was displaying a 3D

              project involving a car or two, and made with Three.js!

              In short, while enabling shadows at the renderer level sets up the
              framework for shadow rendering, we need to specify which objects
              cast and receive shadows in the 3D scene. This level of control
              ensures that we can optimize shadow rendering for our specific
              scene requirements and performance constraints.

              As for the sliding text, it can be achieved by basically disabling
              the ability for the text to wrap, creating a single line of text.
              And I added a sliding animation for the text with CSS keyframes.

              One more thing, the music. So, I added in some from the Gran
              Turismo Sport soundtrack list, and the menu theme from Race
              Driver: GRID.

              So, I've reached the end, after up to 16 hours of work for about
              3-4 days. Do I regret it? Nope, not a single bit. I loved working
              on this project. Hopefully, I'd get the chance to do it again but
              in a professional setting, and with a more powerful computer. Oh,
              my poor 4 year-old laptop, I'm so sorry.

              If you viewed the demo, you may have noticed that the YouTube
              video is different from the demo. It's because I migrated the
              project from Three.js to React-Three-Fiber to learn how it worked,
              and then made some changes from the original Three.js version. But
              that's another topic in and of itself.
            </p>

            <p className="article-text">
              I now prefer working in React-Three-Fiber for Three.js projects. I
              don't have to do the initial setup and all that jazz in R3F.
